Justin, one of the founders of [kidsinneedofgrace.com](https://www.kidsinneedofgrace.com/), 
wanted to make it easier for Christians to find community in the greater Jackson 
area. He requested that I build an user interface that would enable users to 
filter a list of communities by city, state, event name, organizer, and whether 
or not it meets virtually. You can find the source code for the component 
[here](https://github.com/phyiction/king-components) or try it out on the 
website [here](https://www.kidsinneedofgrace.com/pages/community).
